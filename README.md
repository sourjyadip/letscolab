# letscolab
An online text editor to collaboratively write code.

The main site allows the user to write HTML, CSS and javascript code and it shows a demo of the page in real time. 
This project uses TogetherJS - a javascript framework that allows users to interact with collaborators by reflecting changes in the page in real time and also has a chat feature.
